# SplunkConfDashboard

PLA1431C - Visualizing Wealth and Lifespan in the Caribbean Islands

Nadine Shillingford, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science, Meharry Medical College

In this talk, I will use Splunk to recreate global health researcher, Dr. Hans Rosling's “The Joy of Stats” talk which he used to debunk myths about world development. My goal is to use interactive Splunk dashboards annotated with world events (sourced from OpenAI calls) to show how countries vary in wealth and lifespan over time. The talk will focus on a select number of Caribbean islands. This project is being developed as part of a course in the School of Applied Computational Sciences at Meharry Medical College.
